This website is built in Gatsby using React and Typescript. I also used this opportunity to learn about css modules, which were a useful if somewhat infrastructure-heavy way of organizing styling.

I chose not to use a frontend framework, opting instead to build everything from scratch for the heck of it.

I spent by far the most time learning about, creating, and implementing functionality into the svg of myself on the front page. Among the more interesting challenges was learning a lot about svg masks for eye movements and for the circular frame. I'll likely continue tooling around with svgs here intermittently.

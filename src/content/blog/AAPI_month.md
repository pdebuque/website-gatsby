# On Asian-American identity and representation
## What does it mean to be Asian-American?

I am currently in my second year as the Chancel Choir Director at a wonderful Methodist church in Edina, Minnesota. In my first year, I piloted a program series commemorating AAPI (Asian-American/Pacific Islander) Month: for three services in May, the music was led by either myself or a fellow Asian-American musician, with the express purpose of creating a space for expression and authentic sharing and learning for the predominantly white choir and congregation. 

Creating a collaborative space that served both the artists and the congregation was a multi-step process, including identifying specific goals for the collaborations, conversing openly with artists and choir members to share these goals, and finally a letter to the whole congregation outlining the project and priming them to receive the musical products in the spirit that they were conceived.

The following is the letter (lightly edited for clarity) to the congregation.

### Dear Good Samaritans,

I am thrilled to share that this May, Good Samaritan will be commemorating AAPI (Asian-American/Pacific Islander) month in America, using our musical resources to celebrate the contributions and experiences of AAPI people in this country. We have set aside three Sundays in the month to highlight the musical experiences of AAPI colleagues: May 1st, 8th, and 22nd. In this inaugural iteration, we have been careful not to bite off more than we can chew, and will use our experience through this month to identify possible directions for growth and refinement in future years.

As we prepare to embark on this exciting endeavor, there is an issue I’d like to address directly, a pitfall that predominantly white organizations can often fall prey to in pursuing otherwise well-intentioned cultural programming: the burden of representation. This phenomenon, first articulated by James Baldwin when speaking of his experiences as a prominent black writer, is a weight of responsibility imposed on members of marginalized populations, especially in the context of public expressions of identity or experience. Baldwin described it as “the homely notion that you represent your race, thus that your actions can betray your race or honor it.”

I see this burden foisted on people of color and other members of marginalized populations when those around them are interested (consciously or not) in learning about a broad, generalized experience, i.e., “what is it like to be *XYZ*?” (*XYZ* can be AAPI, black, queer, female, etc.). Embedded in this curiosity is the assumption that there exists some platonic “XYZ experience” that all members of *XYZ* must have in common. This assumption can be quite damaging! Growing up, I felt pressure to identify the “Asian-American experience” and figure out how to understand my own life through that imagined lens. Failing to do so, for a while I questioned the legitimacy of my own identity: am I truly Asian-American if I can’t position myself in that stream?

Only recently have I learned to turn the question on its head: I **am** Asian-American. Therefore the Asian-American experience **is** my experience. The question that matters, then, is not “what is it like to be Asian-American?” but “what has being Asian-American meant to you?” That is a question I am excellently equipped to answer!
With all this in mind, in welcoming their experiences and perspectives into our congregation, I have intentionally not asked our guests to go out of their way to answer broad questions like “what is it like to be *XYZ*?” or even “what are the musical traditions of *XYZ* like?” Maybe in future years we can invite guests equipped to answer such questions. Instead, I have asked them to bring music that excites them, and that speaks to their personal experience as AAPI folk. The central question is something more like “When you reflect on your lived experience as an AAPI person, what music resonates?”

I hope you share my excitement in hearing and learning from the various answers to that question as they arise in the coming month! As always, I and the rest of the music staff are grateful for your support, and glad to be working with this wonderful congregation.
